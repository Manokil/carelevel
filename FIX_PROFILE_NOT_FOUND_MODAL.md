# Fix: "Profile Not Found" Modal After Signup

## 🔍 **Problem**

After a new user signs up, they see the "Profile Not Found" modal instead of being able to access the app. This happens because:

1. **Profile creation was delayed** until after email confirmation
2. **User tries to access the app** before email confirmation
3. **No profile exists** in the database yet
4. **"Profile Not Found" modal appears** instead of the app

## 🚀 **Solution Implemented**

### 1. **Updated Signup Flow**
- **Profile created immediately** during signup, regardless of email confirmation status
- **Profile exists in database** even before email confirmation
- **User can access the app** immediately after signup (if no email confirmation required)

### 2. **Code Changes Made**

**Before (Problematic):**
```typescript
// Profile only created if no email confirmation needed
if (data.user && data.session) {
  // Create profile only here
}
```

**After (Fixed):**
```typescript
// Profile always created immediately
if (data.user) {
  // Create profile immediately
  const { error: profileError } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .insert({
      id: authedUserId,
      username,
      full_name: fullName,
      mail_address: email,
    });
  
  // Then check if email confirmation needed
  if (!data.session) {
    // Show email confirmation message
  }
}
```

### 3. **How It Works Now**

1. **User fills out signup form** → Clicks "Sign Up"
2. **Profile is created immediately** in the database
3. **If email confirmation required** → User sees success message to check email
4. **If no email confirmation** → User is logged in and can access the app
5. **No more "Profile Not Found" modal** because profile always exists

## 🎯 **Benefits**

- ✅ **No more "Profile Not Found" modal**
- ✅ **Profile exists immediately** after signup
- ✅ **Works with email confirmation** flow
- ✅ **Works without email confirmation** flow
- ✅ **Better user experience**

## 🧪 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Sign up with a new email**
2. **Check if profile is created** (should be in database)
3. **If email confirmation required** → Check email and click link
4. **Login** → Should work without "Profile Not Found" modal
5. **Access the app** → Should work normally

## 📋 **Important Notes**

- **RLS policies must be set up** (run the SQL script from previous fix)
- **Profile is created with user's chosen username and full name**
- **Email confirmation still works** as expected
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality

The "Profile Not Found" modal should no longer appear after signup! 🎉
