## üé® Color Psychology

### Light Mode:
- `#FAFAFA` background = Professional, clean, modern
- `#FFFFFF` cards = Pure, elevated, important content
- Creates a "clean workspace" feeling

### Dark Mode:
- `#0A0E13` background = Deep, immersive, focused
- `#1A1F26` cards = Content stands out, easy to scan
- Creates a "premium app" feeling

## üìù Key Improvements
